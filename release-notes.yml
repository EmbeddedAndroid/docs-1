summary: |
 This release includes an mcuboot tree based very closely on the 0.9.0
 release, and a Zephyr tree that is based between the 1.9-rc1 and
 1.9-rc2 tags. It also includes a new IoT Foundry application.

 The Zephyr tree includes many new features and bug fixes. Notable
 improvements for the Zephyr microPlatform include LWM2M protocol
 support, mainline support for 96Boards Carbon networking, DTLS
 support for the net_app library, and various Bluetooth and networking
 fixes.

 A new IoT Foundry application was added for a demonstration system

  - name: Zephyr microPlatform
    summary: |
      A new end-to-end IoT system based on the LWM2M protocol has been
      added, along with an updated Zephyr tree, which provides
      protocol support along with many other feature additions and
      improvements.

      Networking Support for 96Boards Carbon (which is supported on a
      best-effort basis by the microPlatform) was merged into the
      Zephyr mainline.

      This Zephyr release includes several significant API breaks due
      to refactoring and renaming. These are present in the features
      list below, alongside legitimate feature additions.

          - heading: Improved Zephyr sample applications.
            summary: |
              The Zephyr sample applications have been reduced to a

          - heading: Bluetooth configuration namespace renamed
            summary: |
              In a breaking API change, upstream has changed the
              Bluetooth Kconfig namespace from CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_* to
              CONFIG_BT_*. All applications which use Bluetooth, along
              with any out of tree patches, will need updates.
              Bluetooth Controller Kconfig options were also renamed
              from CONFIG_BT_CONTROLLER_* to CONFIG_BT_CTLR_*. A small
              set of other Bluetooth fixes and improvements were also
              merged.

              (LWM2M) protocol, provided and maintained by the Linaro
              Technologies Division, was merged into the Zephyr
              mainline. This includes IPSO Light Control object
              support.

              A fully documented sample application named lwm2m_client
              was merged.
          - heading: sa_family field added to struct sockaddr
