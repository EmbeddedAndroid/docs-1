End-to-end Demonstration Systems
================================

In order to provide fully-connected end-to-end IoT Platforms, we have created
the IoT Foundry.  The IoT Foundry is comprised of Cloud data and device
management systems, a Basic IoT Gateway based on the Linux MicroPlatform and
Devices running the appropriate protocols for communicating to the Cloud
systems running Zephyr MicroPlatform software.  We continuously test, maintain
and keep syncronization with the upstream projects the entire demo systems.

The two end-to-end demonstration systems we currently support are:

HTTP / MQTT via Hawkbit
