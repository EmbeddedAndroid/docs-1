Open Source Foundries microPlatforms
====================================

The **Zephyr and Linux microPlatforms** are minimal, secure,
continuously updated software and hardware platforms that make it
easier to develop and maintain Internet-connected embedded
devices. The microPlatforms are easy to use and are released as open
source software.

- The :ref:`zephyr-top`, based on the Zephyr real-time operating
  system, is targeted at microcontroller-based devices.

- The :ref:`linux-top`, based on OpenEmbedded / Yocto and Docker, is targeted
  at Linux-based devices.

- :ref:`iotfoundry-top` shows you how to combine the microPlatforms
  with server and cloud applications to create complete systems.
  Using these systems, you can publish sensor data from devices to the
  cloud and perform firmware over the air (FOTA) updates of the device
  firmware.
