Getting Started: Install Linux microPlatform
============================================

This page describes how to install the base Linux microPlatform onto a
device. All you need to get started is a gateway device supported by
the Linux microPlatform, a computer, and an Internet connection.

For a complementary guide on getting set up to develop and deploy
containerized applications onto your device, see :ref:`iot-gateway`.

Get Hardware
------------

Here's what you'll need:

- A computer to develop on. This can be running Windows, Mac OS X, or
  Linux.

- A gateway device supported by the Linux microPlatform. We currently
  recommend getting started with the `Raspberry Pi 3`_.

Next Steps
----------

You've now successfully installed the Linux microPlatform, booted into
your device's console, and connected it to the network.

Your device is now ready for use. The Linux microPlatform makes it
easy for you to deploy applications to your device as either one
solitary or multiple coordinating Docker containers.

We recommend these next steps:

#. First, move on to :ref:`iot-gateway` to get set up to deploy IoT
   gateway applications on the Linux microPlatform, allowing other
   devices on local networks (including :ref:`zephyr-top` devices) to
   communicate with the cloud.

#. Then use your device in IoT reference systems provided by Open
   Source Foundries in :ref:`iotfoundry-top`.

#. Once you've got a demonstration system working, start customizing
   for your needs.
