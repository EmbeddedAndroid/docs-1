Genesis Overview
================

**Genesis** is an extensible software and hardware platform that makes
it easier to develop, secure, and maintain Internet-connected embedded
devices. Genesis is based on the `Zephyr
<https://www.zephyrproject.org/>`_ real-time operating system (RTOS),
but it's more than just an operating system: it's a complete
development environment.
