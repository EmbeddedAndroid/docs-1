Open Source Foundries microPlatforms
====================================

The **Zephyr and Linux microPlatforms** are minimal, secure,
continuously updated software and hardware platforms that make it
easier to develop and maintain Internet-connected embedded
devices. The microPlatforms are easy to use and are released as open
source software.

The microPlatforms documentation is being restructured. The new,
in-progress documentation is available in the following pages.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   tutorial/index
   howto/index
   reference/index
   other/index

Older pages are available below. These are being migrated to the new
documentation tree above.
